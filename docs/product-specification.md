# Product Overview: The Professional Growth Platform

## 1. The Core Concept
This is a "Portfolio-as-a-Service" platform. It allows users to build their professional identity using a "Digital LEGO" workspace and then use advanced analytics to see exactly how recruiters interact with their personal brand.

## 2. Feature Set: The User Experience
### A. The "Digital LEGO" Workspace (Grid Editor)
* **Smart Grid:** Users drag and drop "Blocks" (text, images, skill bars, social feeds) onto a workspace. 
* **Live Blocks:** Includes interactive progress bars for skills and video introduction spots.
* **The Magic Preview:** A real-time toggle allows users to see how their custom grid looks on mobile vs. desktop while building.

### B. Success Insights (Advanced Analytics)
* **Popularity Heatmap:** Shows which projects are being clicked the most.
* **Recruiter Tracking:** Insights into visitor locations and referral sources.
* **Action Reports:** Tracks "conversions" like resume downloads and contact form submissions.

### C. Total Identity Control
* **Atmosphere Themes:** Pre-designed aesthetics that change fonts and styles instantly.
* **Brand Color Matching:** The system suggests a color palette based on an uploaded logo.

### D. The Growth Toolkit
* **Instant Alerts:** Users receive a notification the second a recruiter downloads their CV.
* **Short-Links:** Provides clean, professional URLs (e.g., site.com/username).

## 3. Core Requirements (Original MVP)
* **Bilingual Support:** Full English/French switching functionality.
* **Secure Admin:** Private management dashboard for every user.
* **Testimonial Moderation:** A system to approve or reject community feedback before it goes live.
* **Contact System:** Messages sent through a portfolio are stored in the user's private inbox.
